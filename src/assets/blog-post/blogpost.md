## Invasive Species in Michigan Waterways
### Introduction

NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) is responsible for collecting information on invasive species in the Great Lakes area. We partnered with them to structure, analyze, and visualize their records on invasive species.

> The current understanding of many marine species, their links to other components of the ecosystems, and the benefits they provide to society is limited; in many instances, scientists have virtually no data. Adequate assessments have been performed for fewer than 60 percent of the key fish stocks and complexes, fewer than 25 percent of all protected species, and an even smaller percentage of the habitat upon which all of these species depend. In addition, it is not yet fully understood how complex ecosystems or individual species will respond either to a changing climate or available approaches to managing living marine resources.  ~ <span style="color:blue">[<span style="color:#027d8d">NOAA’s Goals</span>](https://www.performance.noaa.gov/goals/)

Michigan is famous for its lakes and rivers—its very shape is defined by the Great Lakes.  However, globalization is impacting the ecosystems of Michigan’s waterways by introducing invasive species, [<span style="color:#027d8d">costing more than $100 million annually</span>](https://www.andersoneconomicgroup.com/Portals/0/upload/AEG%20-%20AIS%20Impact_%209-20-2016%20Public.pdf).  In addition, state and federal governments are spending enormous amounts of money to mitigate their impact, for example, budgeting over [<span style="color:#027d8d">$858 million to prevent invasive carp from entering the Great Lakes</span>](https://apnews.com/article/technology-lake-michigan-army-fish-chicago-7e40381283991c37eec7a08552daddf4).

Dealing effectively with these invaders requires information, not only about the invaders themselves but also about the ecosystem in which they inhabit and their relationships with other species.  Much of this information is unavailable, inaccessible, or unconnected to related data.

### Current State of Field

The information that is available comes primarily from researchers who document the behaviors and impacts specific species have on an ecosystem.  GLERL collects and organizes this information on invasive species in the Great Lakes region. Policy makers and researchers rely on the collected data to make regulations that maintain the health of America’s most prominent ecosystem.

Maintaining these records is not an easy task. GLERL scours everything from academic papers to homeowner association pamphlets to get the needed information and collects it into long (1,000+ page) [<span style="color:#027d8d">technical reports and annual updates</span>](https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/pubs/#techRep).  Reviewing the reports and associated research and entering the compiled information into their database has always been a challenge.

For our project, we structured, analyzed, and visualized GLERL records on invasive species.   As sportsmen, conservationists, and data scientists we seek to maintain the beauty and vitality of Great Lakes waterways for our children and grandchildren.

## Increased Available Research Findings by 750%
### Structuring Data

We algorithmically processed 3,300 pages of technical reports and created 3,100 structured scientific findings that will be added to the [<span style="color:#027d8d">Great Lakes Aquatic Nonindigenous Species Information System (GLANSIS)</span>](https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/glansis/), increasing their entries by over 750%.

The technical reports detail the potential impacts of invasive species on an ecosystem and are freely available on [<span style="color:#027d8d">GLERL’s website</span>](https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/pubs/#techRep).

<div style="text-align:center" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadsCapstone/blogpost/main/blog_images/blog_1_technical_report.png" width="50%"/></div>

In order to make the information more accessible, GLERL dedicates a portion of their database to records dealing with possible invasive species and their potential impact on the ecosystem.  These records, called impact statements, are organized by invasive species and include information on the source of the findings and the species impacted.

<div style="text-align:center" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadsCapstone/blogpost/main/blog_images/blog_2_impact_statements.png" width="100%"/></div>


Converting the unstructured nature of the reports into the structured form of the impact statements has always been a challenge for GLERL. Our team processed more than six years of reports, combined them with ten other tables, and prepared a final file for entry into the database.

We located and extracted the text related to the impact statements by reading the PDF files and converting them to plain text, and then used regex and a naïve Bayes classifier to locate section headings and key phrases and extract relevant information.  By extracting, normalizing and matching citations to references in the bibliography, we matched 60% of the impact statements to references in GLERL’s database.

Extracting and identifying the impacted species in each statement proved to be a challenge.  Species were referenced at different levels of taxonomic rank (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species) and sometimes by one of their many common names, so we quickly standardized our naming conventions.  With GLERL’s advice, we opted to use the naming conventions in the predator-prey relationships (see below). We built dictionaries to translate the names into a common ontology and matched our ontology to the identification numbers used in GLERL's database.

Each record was missing two critical values not in the technical reports: study type and study location.  These two values are based on the judgement of the researcher entering the report, and sometimes researchers do not agree.  We trained Random Forest Classifiers on existing impact statements and used them to impute the values for the impact statements we had extracted.  Through feature engineering and vectorization of the title, abstract, and journal, we were able to achieve a 73% accuracy for the study type and 80% for the study location with an 80-20 train-test split with only 992 labeled examples, a value limited by the incomplete information about many of the references (missing abstracts, journals, etc.).  We retrained the classifier on the complete set and then imputed the data.

Lastly, we compiled a completed table and exported it as an Excel file for upload into the database.

### Findings, Methodology & Ethical Considerations
- Choose the Right Library: The libraries used to extract the text varied in extraction accuracy (90% to 100%) and processing time (30 min to 30 seconds).  Test several options for performance before committing to a specific tool.
- Beware Inconsistencies: We extracted information that had been compiled by hand and matched it to a specific data model. Differences in spelling, format, and spacing required careful consideration and introduced potential uncertainty into our findings.
- Information Availability: Organizations are sometimes reluctant to provided unfettered access to their data.  Clearly state your complete expectations and requirements for data access in the negotiation stage: come to a clear understanding before you proceed.
- Ontology Matters: The different levels present in the naming conventions of the species, references, and waterways (see below) made combining datasets more art than science.  Consult with domain experts and heed their advice.
- Understand Your Data: Datasets vary in a myriad of ways, including accuracy, completeness, and specificity. Understand and clearly communicate the limitations of your data, so users can make informed decisions.
- Pipeline First: Quickly producing results in each step and learning how the datasets interact saves time downstream.  Follow the Pareto Principle and get the 80% done first—then go back and polish.
- Missing Data: Data collection varies considerably and is neither uniform nor random. The quantity of information collected does not reflect its quality. Review the density of data and clearly communicate possible limitations.

## Pioneered Network Model of Invasive Species
### Building Networks

Traditional databases relate tables to other tables, and when properly designed allow users to quickly determine direct relationships between entries.  However, finding indirect relationships between data and exploring the relationships between multiple entries in these systems is difficult.  Graphs explicitly model relationships between entries as a network, allowing users to explore direct and indirect relationships between multiple entries and opening up entirely new ways of analyzing systems.

### Species Network

We created a species graph that allows researchers for the first time to discover invaders impacting selected species and identify indirect relationships.

The species graph was based on the predator-prey relationships we extracted from GLERL’s foodwebs and is represented as a two-column dataframe (predator, prey).  We combined this with the relationships from the impact statements, normalized the data, and represented it as a graph using NetworkX. To get a measure of how species impact each other, we calculated the shortest path (if any) between each pair of species and saved the results as a three column dataframe.

### Waterways Invasion Network

We created an invasion risk graph that allows researchers to identify the possible risk of invasive species spreading into new waterways.

We wanted to model regional lakes and rivers as a graph, so we could determine the potential spread of invasive species.  [<span style="color:#027d8d">USGS’s National Hydrography Dataset (NHDPlus HR)</span>](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution)  includes a table of waterway intersections (nodes) and waterways in and out.  To create a waterway network, we pruned and restructured the data as a table of paired waterways, one connected to the other, and then added the names of the waterways.

<div style="text-align:center" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadsCapstone/blogpost/main/blog_images/blog_3_waterways.png" width="100%"/></div>

Next, we connected a list of invasive species observations maintained by GLERL to the waterway network. We did this by downloading and flattening two geojson files, extracting 2 million geographical coordinates representing regional lakes and rivers, and used [<span style="color:#027d8d">SciPy’s cKDTree</span>](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.cKDTree.html) to find the closest waterway for each observation.  We mapped the waterway names to the waterway ID and saved the result as a two-column waterway relationship table.

We created the graph by importing the table into NetworkX, and then calculated the shortest distance between each species and waterway and saved it as a normalized table with three values (species, waterway, and distance) representing the potential spread of each invasive species in each waterway.

### Findings, Methodology & Ethical Considerations
- Standardize Representation:  Maintaining consistent representation of data is essential, particularly when dealing with multiple unstructured datasets.  Exploring your data and getting a pipeline working early on is essential for efficient progress.
- Use Graphs: The world is built of networks. Using graphs to represent data allows you to analyze a system as a whole and identify important indirect relationships between entities that a database cannot.
- Uncertainty Cascade: The downstream effects of generalization and uncertainty grow over time.  As George Box said in 1978, “All models are wrong, but some of them are useful.”  The importance of communicating this clearly cannot be overestimated.
- Incomplete Research: GLERL’s foodwebs and the invasive impact findings are incomplete, so our networks should only be used as a starting point for research in these areas.  Lack of information does not equate to lack of relationship.
- Beware Unknown Basics: Information availability is independent of information importance.  With no information available on existing species in a waterway, we had to drop one main visualization.  Double-check the availability of all data before you start.

## Made Models Accessible to Researchers
### Inventing Visualizations

We created easy-to-understand visualizations that allow researchers to explore the spread and impact of invasive species in Great Lakes waterways.

### Architecture

We used a thin, lightweight application on the front end housing the logic to make interactive visualizations and display text with tools including React, React Ploytly.js, and React Mapbox-gl.js.  We built the layout using React and JSX, the logic and API requests with Javascript, and UI components outside the visualizations with Material-UI. Delivering only necessary data to the frontend allows the visualizations to load quickly and be viewed from anywhere Internet is available.

To process most of the data, we set up the database as a Google Cloud Project (GCP) Cloud SQL using a PostgreSQL database.  For the backend, we use a Flask REST application with an MVC architecture exposing an API that serves necessary data to the frontend as a JSON object.  We use Kubernetes for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CICD) and GitHub actions to make the system easy to manage and change.

### River Plot

We created an [<span style="color:#027d8d">interactive map</span>](/project/VizOne) showing the existence and potential spread of a selected invasive species.

Our waterway invasion network was connected to a geojson file with named waterways.  Then, we mapped the existence and potential spread of invasive species onto vector tiles as layers on a map using Mapbox and used color to represent the distance from an observation in a different layer. This allows the map to render vast amounts of data very quickly.

<div style="text-align:center" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadsCapstone/blogpost/main/blog_images/blog_4_river_plot.png" width="100%"/></div>

As you can see above, grass carp are present in many rivers (shown in red) near the University of Michigan Campus in Ann Arbor.  In rivers shown in orange and yellow, the species has not yet been observed but there is a risk of invasion due to their connections to invaded waterways. In rivers shown in blue, the risk is potentially limited by the lack of connected invader waterways.

### Ripple Plot

We invented the ripple plot, a network visualization which displays nth order relationships in concentric circles around a node, and
created an [<span style="color:#027d8d">interactive version</span>](/project/VizTwo) to display the cascading effects of an invasive species on an ecosystem. Alternatively, the plot can be used to display the cumulative effects of invasive species on a selected species.

Displaying the first to third order species impacting or being impacted by invasive species is completely new.  According to GLERL, **this information has never been available**. Therefore, **this is the first representation of this data that has ever been created**.

<div style="text-align:center" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadsCapstone/blogpost/main/blog_images/blog_5_ripple_invasive.png" width="100%"/></div>

The plot above shows the direct and indirect impacts of killer shrimp on the Great Lakes ecosystem directly impacting amphipods (1st order) and indirectly impacting bacteria (2nd order) and smelt (3rd order).

<div style="text-align:center" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadsCapstone/blogpost/main/blog_images/blog_6_ripple_plot_impacted.png" width="100%"/></div>

The plot above shows the direct and indirect impact on chinook by invasive species in the Great Lakes region.  Chinook are directly impacted by alewife (1st order) and indirectly impacted by round goby (2nd order) and zebra mussels (3rd order).  Including only invaders highlights their impact.

### Species Plot

We created a [<span style="color:#027d8d">network visualization</span>](/project/VizOne) showing how a single species relates to the other species in the ecosystem.

Displaying the entire network impacted by a specific species provides insight into the complexity and interconnected nature of the ecosystem.  Here we display how a species selected for the river plot, the grass carp, connects to the system as a whole. As you can see, the directly impacted organisms include crayfish and protozoans, while the indirectly impacted organisms are much more spread out and reflect the complexity of the entire system.

<div style="text-align:center" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadsCapstone/blogpost/main/blog_images/blog_7_network.png" width="100%""/></div>

### Findings, Methodology & Ethical Considerations

- [<span style="color:#027d8d">Coastline Paradox</span>](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CoastlineParadox.html): The length of a coastline increases as the size of the ruler used to measure it decreases. Representing the rivers as a network of named waterways makes the visualization easier to process and understand but ignores the potential impact of unnamed waterways. Focusing on individual segments would have preserved more locality and possibly underfitted the data.  Understand the ruler you use, and its impact on the final results.
- Impact Complexity:  We represented an impact as one species impacting another, but relationships are rarely so one-sided.  The ease of understanding also limits a broader analysis.  Know and communicate the limitations of the representations you choose.
- Citation Omissions:  GLERL always cites the source of findings, but we opted for a simplified representation.  Adding links to the source of the data would properly credit the original findings and provide researchers with more context.
- Inland Foodwebs: Foodweb data for inland waterways was not available, so our graph is incomplete.  Include the absence of data in analyses and recognize limitations.
- Measure Impact: The networks treat all impacts equally. Adding strength to the impacts between species or waterways, or representing the species as agents in an agent-based model would allow richer and more accurate representations of the data.
- Oversimplification: Our representations provide a starting point for research by simplifying a highly complex system. Simple representations should never be used by themselves to make large decisions.
- Peer Review: Our visualizations represent the data in GLERL’s database and technical reports. However, the visualizations have not been reviewed by biologists, and the limitations of our approach have not been fully explored. Feedback from domain experts is priceless.

## Endless Possibilities
### Going Forward
- Database Management: Automating the database will speed its growth and potentially expand its reach.
- Inland Foodwebs: Adding foodwebs and species information for inland waterways will allow visualizations to be tailored to a selected waterbody.
- Link to Resources: Adding links to outside resources is necessary to make this a hub for biological research.
- Additional Graphs: Adding information on water quality or flow rates will both increase the accuracy of the model and allow more complex interactions to be identified and explored.

## Smarter Systems from Data
### Conclusion

By substantially increasing the available findings in GLERL’s database, pioneering the representation of invader impacts and invaded waterways as networks, and inventing new tools for researchers to explore these relationships, we believe we have aided GLERL in their mission to [<span style="color:#027d8d">research ecosystem dynamics, integrate physical and ecological modeling and forecasting, and develop observing systems and technology</span>](https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/).

We are confident that our findings and tools will guide new research and provide a basis for future systems.  More importantly, we believe they will be used to protect and conserve the ecosystems of Great Lakes waterways for ourselves and our descendants.
