# Our Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Because it is easy and clean.

# The Motivation

React is a tool to build user interfaces and provides a declaritve ways to build UIs. We wanted to disaply our project information 
for our project in a tool that was responsive and ran in the browser. 

It uses our backend to fetch only necessary data. Our scripts were ran once to generate the data that was then inserted in the database. 
The backend end will then service that to this application running in your browser. 


# You can run this locally...
1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure you have `node.js` installed
3. Test it by running these scripts below
   1. I recommend using ```npm start```
4. You will have some config to make but it might not work without modifying source a bit.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
